# Maze-Solving Robot

Welcome to the Maze-Solving Robot repository! This project aims to create a robot capable of solving a maze using computer vision algorithms. The robot is programmed to scan the maze and generate the shortest path. Using inverse kinematics, the path is converted to joint angles to trace the path using a five-bar mechanism.

## Repository Contents

- **Python Code**: Contains the Python code responsible for running the maze-solving algorithm.
- **Arduino Code**: Includes the C++ code to be uploaded to the Arduino microcontroller, which interfaces with the robot's hardware components.
- **Images**: Contains images related to the project, such as maze layouts and the robot itself.
